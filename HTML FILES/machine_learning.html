          One of our great scientists, Stephen Hawking, said that “The development
          of full Artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race”.
          Artificial Intelligence is a very hot topic actually nowadays. We always
          wonder what else it can do, how it is a very interesting, strange, and
          special topic for our generation. Machine Learning is one of the topics
          in AI, which gives us the same feeling. Today in this article, we will
          explore about the Machine Learning in a simple way. How it can learn
          anything, examples, and their applications
        </p>
  
        <h3>What Is Machine Learning?</h3>
  
        <p>
          Machine learning is nothing new. The history, in fact, dates back over
          sixty years to when Alan Turing created the ‘Turing test’ to determine
          whether a computer had real intelligence. It can be argued, however,
          that the past 25-30 years have seen the biggest leaps and bounds in
          terms of advances in speech technology. But I’m getting ahead of myself
          here.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Think of machine learning like this. As a human, and as a user of
          technology, you complete certain tasks that require you to make an
          important decision or classify something. For instance, when you read
          your inbox in the morning, you decide to mark that ‘Win a Free Cruise if
          You Click Here’ email as spam. How would a computer know to do the same
          thing? Machine learning is comprised of algorithms that teach computers
          to perform tasks that human beings do naturally on a daily basis.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The first attempts at artificial intelligence involved teaching a
          computer by writing a rule. If we wanted to teach a computer to make
          recommendations based on the weather, then we might write a rule that
          said: IF the weather is cloudy AND the chance of rainfall is greater
          than 50%, THEN suggest taking an umbrella. The problem with this
          approach used in traditional expert systems, however, is that we don’t
          know how much confidence to place on the rule. Is it right 50% of the
          time? More? Less?
        </p>
  
        <p>
          For this reason, machine learning has evolved to mimic the
          pattern-matching that human brains perform. Today, algorithms teach
          computers to recognize features of an object. In these models, for
          example, a computer is shown an apple and told that it is an apple. The
          computer then uses that information to classify the various
          characteristics of an apple, building upon new information each time. At
          first, a computer might classify an apple as round, and build a model
          that states that if something is round, it’s an apple. Then later, when
          an orange is introduced, the computer learns that if something is round
          AND red, it’s an apple. Then a tomato is introduced, and so on and so
          forth. The computer must continually modify its model based on new
          information and assign a predictive value to each model, indicating the
          degree of confidence that an object is one thing over another. For
          example, yellow is a more predictive value for a banana than red is for
          an apple.
        </p>
  
        <h3>So Why Is Everyone Talking About Machine Learning?</h3>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            These basic algorithms for teaching a machine to complete tasks and
            classify like a human date back several decades. The difference
            between now and when the models were first invented is that the more
            information is fed into the algorithms, the more accurate they become.
            The past few decades have seen massive scalability of data and
            information, allowing for much more accurate predictions than were
            ever possible in the long history of machine learning.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            New techniques in the field – that mostly involve combining pieces
            that already existed in the past – have enabled an extraordinary
            research effort in Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This has not been the
            result of a major breakthrough, but rather of much faster computers
            and thousands of researchers contributing incremental improvements.
            This has enabled researchers to expand what’s possible, to the point
            that machines are outperforming humans for difficult but narrowly
            defined tasks such as recognizing faces or playing the game of Go.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>The Importance Of Machine Learning</h3>
  
        <p>
          Machine learning has several very practical applications that drive the
          kind of real business results – such as time and money savings – that
          have the potential to dramatically impact the future of your
          organization. At Interactions in particular, we see tremendous impact
          occurring within the customer care industry, whereby machine learning is
          allowing people to get things done more quickly and efficiently. Through
          Virtual Assistant solutions, machine learning automates tasks that would
          otherwise need to be performed by a live agent – such as changing a
          password or checking an account balance. This frees up valuable agent
          time that can be used to focus on the kind of customer care that humans
          perform best: high touch, complicated decision-making that is not as
          easily handled by a machine. At Interactions, we further improve the
          process by eliminating the decision of whether a request should be sent
          to a human or a machine: unique Adaptive Understanding Technology, the
          machine learns to be aware of its limitations, and bail out to humans
          when it has a low confidence in providing the correct solution.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Machine learning has made dramatic improvements in the past few years,
          but we are still very far from reaching human performance. Many times,
          the machine needs the assistance of human to complete its task. At
          Interactions, we have deployed Virtual Assistant solutions that
          seamlessly blend artificial with true human intelligence to deliver the
          highest level of accuracy and understanding.
        </p>
  
        <h3>
          To conclude, machine learning is the future that is knocking on our
          doors with increasing urgency. The question is, are we ready to open the
          door and welcome it into our lives?
