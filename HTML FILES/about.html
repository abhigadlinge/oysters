        <p>
          Oyesters started its operation in 2017 as a boutique training institute. Our aim was clear to provide quality based
  technical and soft skills training to students at all levels. So that they can address and understand the on going
  problems faced by industries and can find a solution to it.
        </p>
  
        <p>
        
  We soon understood that training is just one side of the story. Industries also need support for developing robust
  ecosystems tools & softwares for managing their internal team as well as clients.
        </p>
  
        <p>
  We started developing a team & infrastructure to build ourself as a software product and service development firm and with countionius effort and dedication today we have 30+ in house developed products serving 50+ big &
  small level clients of ours.
  
        </p>
        <p>
  The journey was not easy. We faced a lot of challenges, rejections and hurdles along the way but they only made
  us more & more stronger. We learned from every mistake we made, improved more and more from every project we completed today we stand strong and competent and are reliable for our clients
