            👉 What is Executive Excellence
        </h3>
        <p>
            Executive Excellence is a six-month program designed for executives to extend leadership impact, strengthen strategic influence and broaden community and industry perspectives.

            It provides cross-department networking opportunities, with highly respected industry experts delivering enriching sector-specific content.

        <h3>
            👉How to develop & Master Executive Excellence

        </h3>
  
        <p>
            Executive presence isn’t just about how others perceive you. It starts with how you perceive yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself and your abilities, that self-doubt will be apparent—no matter what you look like or what clothes you’re wearing. What are the conversations that take place inside your head? Maybe you suffer from imposter syndrome and don’t feel "good enough" to have a seat at the table. Through practice, you can rewire your brain, resulting in a natural alignment of your thoughts and behaviors that profoundly strengthen your leadership presence.
        </p>
  
       
        <h3>👉 Key steps to develop Executive Excellence    </h3>
        <p>
           <p> Step 1: Engage the CEO </p>
           <p> Step 2: Identify the Desired Business Outcomes and the Leadership Capabilities to Deliver them </p>
           <p> Step 3: Engage the teams with the Culture of Excellence Process </p>
            <p>
            Step 4: Create and Implement the Measurable Results Sustainment Plan</p>
           <p> Step 5: Measure the Business Impact and Performance</p>
        </p>
  
        <h3>👉 7 Traits of Executive Excellence        </h3>
        <p>
           <p> Composure: Self-awareness and understanding others are essential components of executive presence. The ability to control your emotions, recognize emotion in others and manage your response to them is key. </p>

          <p>  Connection: It's critical to engage others when communicating and make them feel comfortable. The best way to connect is to understand your communication style challenges, how to overcome them, and how to read and adapt to the style of others. </p>

          <p>  Charisma: People who embody executive presence have the ability to draw others to them. This is often achieved through strong listening skills and an ability to stay "in the moment." As a result, the people with whom you are communicating know that you are solely focused on them, and not distracted by the many other things you could be doing at that moment. They matter to you. </p>

          <p>

          
Confidence: One key aspect of executive presence is to communicate confidence both in what you say and how you say it. To appear confident, good posture is essential. Next, eye focus is critical. Ensure you only speak when making eye contact and manage your eye focus appropriately when communicating with more than one person - one thought per person. Ensure your facial expression matches your message and that your voice has good pitch, volume, and pace. And of course, you must look the part. Choose your wardrobe and accessories carefully.
</p><p>
Credibility: Not only is your content important, but the language you choose to deliver it will impact your credibility. Filler language such as "um," "uh," and "so" immediately detract from presence. As do minimizers like "just," "sort of," and "this may not be a good idea but…" When someone with strong presence speaks, others take note, and there is no doubt of the conviction behind their words.
</p><p>
Clarity: For you to exude presence, the ability to clearly communicate is fundamental. If your point is unclear, any hope of commanding attention is lost. Ask yourself, "What is my message in 10 words or fewer?" If you can't articulate it to yourself you are not ready to communicate it to others.
</p><p>
Conciseness: Being verbose kills presence. Just as it is critical to know what you want to communicate, you must be able to do it concisely. Once you've delivered your message and validated it briefly, reverse back to others by asking, "What else can I share with you about this idea?" This way you stay on point and only expand on a topic with the content that your listener needs.
