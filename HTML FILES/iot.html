            Look around, we are hearing a lot of buzz about IoT (Internet of Things). The world is getting reliant on the internet which is a massive global network that allows people to communicate with each other. We can send emails and messages, use websites and post on social media to communicate with other people. To do all these activities, we use devices like PC, Laptop or mobile devices [smartphones and tablet]. Internet of Things is a big science which deals with the collected data, interconnectedness and devices.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            There are three things which are required in the main process of IoT –
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>
                People
            </li>
            <li>
                Devices (with sensors)
            </li>
            <li>
                Servers
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            The things which are using the internet to make connections and respond to other devices, people or systems are called the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is playing a significant role in our lives and serving as an ecosystem which interconnects physical objects and systems in order to perform task smartly.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            It could be a car which can be monitored to check fuel or its engine condition or an AC which can be operated remotely [like when you are not at home and you have forgotten to off it, you can make it off or operate it without specific AC remote] or any physical object with built-in sensors. These objects have been assigned with an IP address and after building a robust connection, data transfer takes place with manual assistance or computing interventions are generated.
    
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Consumers are demanding devices which support IoT and organizations are trying to capitalize on it. In this post, we would like to throw light on IoT to make your vision more clear towards it.
        </p>
    
        <h3>
            What is IoT?
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            Things or objects that have a sensor attached for exchanging data, and with the help of internet they are used to communicate in order to make decisions are called the Internet of Things. For example, in the IoT living room, the temperature sensor can alert you about upcoming snow and will also make your living room warm before it happens. Also, if you have an IoT based refrigerator, it will let you know about your diet by monitoring your health previously and suggest your best meals with available foodstuff.
    
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The devices are attached to a built-in sensor to send the data to a piece of software or computer to allow them to achieve meaningful tasks.
    According to a report, it is estimated that by 2020, 50 million devices will be connected to the internet. The whole world will be surrounded by millions of sensors.
    
    
        </p>
    
        <h3>
            Why we need IoT?
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            Basically, IoT is an evolution for mobile, home and embedded applications that are connected to the internet, to integrate communication. By using data analytics, these devices derive meaningful information. These devices share the data on the cloud and analyze it in a secure manner and hence our businesses are getting brilliantly transformed in many ways.
    
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Many industries are adopting Internet of Things solutions technology to improve their existing systems. Like a health care centre used IoT devices to improve their medical outcomes, revealing better products faster with low development and maintenance cost in the manufacturing industry, making shopping experiences more enjoyable by getting accurate suggestions, etc. IoT is playing a big role in today’s business system by managing internal processes smoothly and providing much convenience for every task.
    
        </p>
    
        <h3>
            Benefits of IoT
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            IoT is considered as the biggest frontier which can improve our lives in many aspects. Those devices which have never been networked can get connected and respond just like the smart devices do, for e.g. your car, refrigerator, and home speakers. IoT is set to transform our world completely. Let’s have a look at the following benefits of IoT as per the business’s perspective 
    
        </p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>
                Efficient resource utilization
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Reduced human efforts
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Lowers the cost and bring productivity
            </li>
    
            <li>
               Real-time marketing
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Decision analytics
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Better customer experiences
            </li>
    
            <li>
                High-quality data
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>
            How is IoT contributing to businesses?
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            For any business, the customer base is an important factor to become successful. Your customers can make or break the value of your brand. If you are doing well and have good growth in business, it means your customers are already satisfied with your services. Why not you break your comfort zone and try to make them happy instead of just satisfy.
    
    
        </p>
    
        <p>
            There is stiff competition in the market, and brands are regularly making strategies based on the latest trends of the Internet of Things to stay up than their competitors. They are applying almost every trend willingly in their strategies in order to retain their customers and increase the value of their brand as well.
    
    
        </p>
    
        <p>
            IoT is serving as a great and modern platform or tool in today’s time to streamline customer’s service and engagement in an excellent way. Building real-time interactions with your customers is one of the best things in favour of brands and customers both.
    
    
        </p>
    
        <h3>
            Let’s wrap up –
    
    
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            Technologies are playing a crucial part in reinventing our experience on every activity and Internet of Things shares a great part in that. People are curious to know more about the Internet of Things. The biggest irony is that some of you do not want to dive into the depth but want to enjoy the comfort it offers. No matters, if you are a technology lover or a non-techie, it is benefitting all of us in many ways.
    
    
        </p>
        <p>
            Google has launched many IoT devices till dates like Google Duo, Smart home devices, Voice assistant, Self Driving Car and many more. Let’s hope for more in the coming years!!
