          The concept of ‘connectivity’ is going beyond laptops and smartphones as
          we see it moving towards smart cities, smart homes, smart retail, smart
          farming, connected cars, connected wearable devices and connected
          healthcare. In short a connected life. The Internet of Things is a
          popular terminology these days, but unlike many technological fads which
          have come and gone in the last years, the Internet of Things proves to
          be an important trend which is having long lasting effects on the
          society. The term “Internet of Things” itself is used to mean a variety
          of ideas.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          IoT or internet of thing these days we quite often listen to this word.
          The words such as the cyber-attack, hacking we can hear these too
          jointly with IoT. Despite, of the fear of piracy and cyberattack the
          internet of things and IoT applications will grow much more faster in
          the coming years. Ultimately we can say the IoT future scope or the
          future of IoT is very bright. There will a lot of IoT devices which will
          be coming shortly.
        </p>

          If businesses want to regulate themselves before the government does,
          they will have to take steps to ensure the data that feeds their AI is
          fair and unbiased, and that their models are empathetic, transparent,
          and robust. Organizations will also need to implement a way to closely
          monitor their AI — with a robust simulation capability and automated
          oversight –, so it doesn’t go off the rails as it “learns.” So far,
          businesses have come up short, and unless they make meaningful strides,
          government regulators will crank up the heat this year.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          As we all know, a connection precipitates another connection. Earlier in
          the 19th century, only 4% of the people present worldwide knew about the
          Internet, that is when the Internet of Things concept came to light.
          But, realize it became like no one in the earth doesn’t know about the
          Internet of Things. Experts predicts that Indian IoT market will grow
          from $1.5 billion today to more than $9 billion by 2020 with over 2.7
          billion connected devices and growing. Another Gartner report predicts,
          by ‘2020 the number of connected devices across all technologies will
          reach to about 20.6 billion’.
        </p>
  
        <h3>The Real World IoT-Cloud Platform Application:</h3>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            Smart Home Automation: How would you feel if you could switch off
            lights after you left home/office or switch the AC on before reaching
            home? With IoT taking shape there is introduction of a world where all
            the smart devices can be in constant connection with each other and
            are monitored by users remotely via voice commands or by a simple
            click. With the rapid growth of IoT it is predicted Smart Homes will
            be as common as smart phones. It has also been predicted by Gil Press
            that more than two thirds of consumers plan to buy connected
            technology for their homes by 2019.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Smart Wearable Technology: A detailed report by TechRepublic says in
            2016, wearables were sold at a rate of 38 million and a large portion
            of them were fitness trackers and smart watches. These two
            classifications will make up a joint income of $4.9 billion. Wearable
            devices are installed with sensors and softwares which collect data
            and information about the users. This data is later pre-processed to
            extract essential insights about the user. The pre-requisite from Iot
            Technology for wearable applications is to be highly energy efficient,
            low power and small sized. The productivity of data processing
            achieved by various smart wrist wear, hearable, and smart glasses is
            getting closer to where wearables will bring exceptional value to our
            lives.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Connected Vehicles: Gartner predicts that about 250,000,000 connected
            cars will be out on the roads by 2020. So, what really are connected
            cars? IoT engineers have come up with an industry solution for
            connected automobiles that gathers, analyzes, stores and takes action
            on vehicle sensor data. A connected vehicle is one which is able to
            improve and analyze its own operation, maintenance as well as comfort
            of passengers using onboard sensors and internet connectivity. IoT for
            automobiles is a vehicle-to-cloud offering that enables awareness of
            the environment even beyond the vehicles and helps use information to
            establish a relationship with the driver as well.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Industrial Internet: The IIoT (Industrial IoT) enables industrial
            engineering with sensors, software and big data analytics to build
            intelligent equipment. Smart machines are precise and consistent than
            humans in communicating data. And this analytics on the generated data
            can help companies pick inabilities and problems fast. In the
            meanwhile, did you know that about 5.4 million IoT devices will be
            used on oil extraction sites by 2020 to provide environmental metrics
            about extraction sites?
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Smart Cities: IoT has the potential of solving major problems faced by
            the people living in cities like pollution, traffic congestion and
            shortage of energy supplies etc. IoT will empower cities to leverage
            their network to offer advanced smart city applications for citizens,
            new eco-sustainability initiatives and create first-hand opportunities
            for enterprise development.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            IoT in Agriculture: To help increase farm performance, IoT technology
            providers continue to develop IoT cloud based platforms that can
            sense, process and communicate precisely measured environmental data.
            Farms are becoming more connected as farmers realize the potential of
            IoT in helping them reduce cost while achieving improved results.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Smart Retail: IoT Smart Retail enables stores to revolutionize
            customer service while saving time and money, while simultaneously
            providing the consumer with a seamless shopping experience. By
            installing this system, retailers are also able to recapture
            investment dollars while surpassing expectations for tech-savvy
            consumers. Some of the components included in Smart Retail are Power
            shelf, Beacons and Digital Price Tags.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            IoT for Healthcare: Research says IoT in healthcare will be enormous
            in coming years. It aims at enabling people to live healthier life by
            wearing connected devices. For example, through IoT, doctors can use
            GPS services and be prepared for treating patients being brought to
            the hospital in emergency cases.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            IoT in Telecom Industry: Global telecom operators now use IoT enabled
            digital platforms that are a combination of connectivity, analysis,
            security, mobile and cloud to support businesses. This is helping them
            reduce operating costs while enabling end-users to consume technology
            in a business focused manner saving time and money.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>How Many IoT Devices Will There Be In 2025?</h3>
  
        <p>
          We can say one thing for sure the number of IoT or the Internet of
          Things devices will outnumber the total population of the earth. While
          we can even say that the Internet of Things or future of IoT is
          something which is increasing tremendously in an unexpected way.
        </p>
