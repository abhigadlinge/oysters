        <h3> What is decision & the steps involved
        </h3>
        <p>
           <p> Decision making is the process of making choices by identifying a decision, gathering information, and assessing alternative resolutions.

            Using a step-by-step decision-making process can help you make more deliberate, thoughtful decisions by organizing relevant information and defining alternatives. This approach increases the chances that you will choose the most satisfying alternative possible.
        </p>
        <p>

          
            
            Step 1: Identify the decision
            You realize that you need to make a decision. Try to clearly define the nature of the decision you must make. This first step is very important.
                     
        </p><p>
            Step 2: Gather relevant information
            Collect some pertinent information before you make your decision: what information is needed, the best sources of information, and how to get it. This step involves both internal and external “work.” Some information is internal: you’ll seek it through a process of self-assessment. Other information is external: you’ll find it online, in books, from other people, and from other sources.
        </p>   <p>    
            Step 3: Identify the alternatives
            As you collect information, you will probably identify several possible paths of action, or alternatives. You can also use your imagination and additional information to construct new alternatives. In this step, you will list all possible and desirable alternatives.
        </p> <p> 
            Step 4: Weigh the evidence
            Draw on your information and emotions to imagine what it would be like if you carried out each of the alternatives to the end. Evaluate whether the need identified in Step 1 would be met or resolved through the use of each alternative. As you go through this difficult internal process, you’ll begin to favor certain alternatives: those that seem to have a higher potential for reaching your goal. Finally, place the alternatives in a priority order, based upon your own value system.
        </p> <p>   
            Step 5: Choose among alternatives
            Once you have weighed all the evidence, you are ready to select the alternative that seems to be best one for you. You may even choose a combination of alternatives. Your choice in Step 5 may very likely be the same or similar to the alternative you placed at the top of your list at the end of Step 4.
        </p> <p> 
            Step 6: Take action
            You’re now ready to take some positive action by beginning to implement the alternative you chose in Step 5.
        </p> <p>    
            Step 7: Review your decision & its consequences
            In this final step, consider the results of your decision and evaluate whether or not it has resolved the need you identified in Step 1. If the decision has not met the identified need, you may want to repeat certain steps of the process to make a new decision. For example, you might want to gather more detailed or somewhat different information or explore additional alternatives.

        <h3>When not to make serious decisions
</h3>
  
        <p>
            Sometimes we make decisions in the spur of the moment, under times of stress when the adrenaline is pumping. These are not the best circumstances to make any decision, big or small. You’ve likely been in situations like that.

            You’re in a meeting and someone calls for help on a project, and you raise your hand and you are it. You are involved, and you said “yes” again before really thinking it through. Other times, decisions are made too quickly by misspoken words. Too often, in the heat of the moment, angry or hurtful words are said in haste, without forethought, and lives are changed forever.
            
            Recommended reading: Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work
            
            By simply taking more time to think about the pros and cons of your decision and weigh out the consequences, you can help stop yourself from making a mistake.

            Steps to Wise Decision-Making

        </h3>
        <p>
            consider the results of your decision and evaluate whether or not it has resolved the need you identified in Step 1.

        <h3>
            Characteristics of good decision makers

        </h3>
        <p>
            A good decision-maker chooses actions that give the best outcome for themselves and others. They enter into the decision-making process with an open mind and do not let their own biases sway them. They make decisions rationally, after researching alternatives and understanding the consequences.

Good decision-makers involve others when appropriate and use knowledge, data and opinions to shape their final decisions. They know why they chose a particular choice over another. They are confident in their decisions and rarely hesitate after reaching conclusions.

Anyone can be a good decision-maker. Making decisions is an integral part of any job, whether you are in an entry-level position or you make important choices on behalf of your company as an executive.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Decision tree analyses
        </h3>
        <p>
            A decision tree includes the following symbols:

Alternative branches: Alternative branches are two lines that branch out from one decision on your decision tree. These branches show two outcomes or decisions that stem from the initial decision on your tree.

Decision nodes: Decision nodes are squares and represent a decision being made on your tree. Every decision tree starts with a decision node. 

Chance nodes: Chance nodes are circles that show multiple possible outcomes.

End nodes: End nodes are triangles that show a final outcome.

A decision tree analysis combines these symbols with notes explaining your decisions and outcomes, and any relevant values to explain your profits or losses. You can manually draw your decision tree or use a flowchart tool to map out your tree digitally.
